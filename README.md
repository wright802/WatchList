# WatchList
Tracker and launcher for episodes (e.g. Battlestar Galactica)

I had ripped episodes of Battlestar Galactica and wanted a way to keep track of what the episodes are, what order to watch them in, and which particular episodes I had already watched. I found a list on the internet of the best viewing order and downloaded it into a CSV file along with some metadata such as release date.  The WatchList app is really just a single HTML file that contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wrote it using NotePad++.  
This is my first real app using HTML, CSS, and JS.  I found lots of code snippets online, including many from w3schools. 
I've included papaparse.min.js, which is used to parse the CSV master list into JSON data usable by the HTML. I've written parsers before, and they can be tedious to develop and test, and so I was happy to find papaparse. I didn't see a live link so had to download and it should reside in the same folder as the html file.
favicon.png is exactly what it sounds like... I found this online.
icon.png is placed in the top-right corner... again this was found online.
